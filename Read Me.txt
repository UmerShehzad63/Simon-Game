# Simon Game

This is a simple Simon game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Simon is a memory game where players have to remember and repeat sequences of colors and sounds.

## How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Simon will play a sequence of colors by lighting up buttons.
3. Remember the sequence and click the buttons in the same order.
4. If you click the correct sequence, Simon will add another color to the sequence and play it again.
5. If you make a mistake, the game will end, and you can restart by pressing any key.

## Game Controls

- Use your keyboard keys to play the game.
- Click the colored buttons on the screen to repeat the sequence.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery

## Code Overview

The game logic is implemented in JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of the JavaScript code:

- `buttonColours`: An array containing the colors used in the game.
- `gamePattern`: An array to store the sequence of colors generated by Simon.
- `userClickedPattern`: An array to store the sequence of colors clicked by the user.
- `started`: A boolean variable to track whether the game has started.
- `level`: An integer variable to track the current level of the game.

The game has several functions:

- `nextSequence()`: Generates the next color in the sequence and plays the corresponding sound.
- `checkAnswer()`: Compares the user's sequence with the game's sequence to check if it's correct.
- `animatePress()`: Adds a visual effect to the button when clicked.
- `playSound()`: Plays the sound corresponding to the given color.
- `startOver()`: Resets the game to its initial state.
